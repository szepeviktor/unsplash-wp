## Report a bug

[File an issue](https://github.com/xwp/unsplash-wp/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) if you find a bug in the Unsplash Plugin. Providing details for each section predefined in the issue template is much appreciated!

Project maintainers are regularly monitoring issues and aim to fix open bugs quickly.

## Make a suggestion

[File a "feature request" issue](https://github.com/xwp/unsplash-wp/issues/new?template=feature_request.md) if you have a suggestion for a way to improve the Unsplash Plugin, or a request for a new feature.

## Product and code contributions

We'd love to have your help contributing code and features to the Unsplash Plugin! Head to the [Engineering guidelines](contributing/engineering.md) for details on the process you can use to contribute.

## Contributors list policy

The list of contributors who are featured on the WordPress.org plugin directory are subject to change over time. The organizations and individuals who contribute significantly and consistently (e.g. 3-month period) to the project are eligible to be listed. Those listed should generally be considered as those who take responsibility for the project (i.e. owners). Note that contributions include more than just code, though contributors who commit are [most visible](https://github.com/xwp/unsplash-wp/graphs/contributors). The sort order of the contributors list should generally follow the sort order of the GitHub contributors page, though again, this order does not consider work in issues and the support forum, so it cannot be relied on solely.

## Code of conduct

In addition to the Community Guidelines, this project follows an explicit [Code of Conduct](code_of_conduct.md).
